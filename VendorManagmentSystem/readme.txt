About Me

    I'm a Computer Science engineering student with a CGPA of 9.12, currently 
    enriching my skills as an SDE-1 intern at Restaverse. Previously, I interned at 
    Xircls as a Django developer, where I crafted 40 APIs for customer insights. My 
    academic and practical experiences have equipped me to contribute effectively to 
    technology-driven projects.

    Also I had attached my resume
    Thank you for considering my application.
